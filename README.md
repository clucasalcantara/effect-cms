## Easy React

**Motivation:** This project is a workflow to kickstart react applications with basic or no configuration for SSR Environments.
Also we want to create react SPA's in the easiest possible way, because of this we are setting an custom engine called easy react.

The objective beyond Easy React is to be an interface to create, in a more friendly way, a react application structure.

```javascript
// Generators usage example:
console.log('coming soon')
```

```javascript
// Styling

```

```javascript
// Building and dev
console.log('coming soon')
```

```javascript
// Deploying
console.log('coming soon')
```
